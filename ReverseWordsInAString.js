// Reverse Words in a String

/*
Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
The words in s will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated
by a single space.

Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple
spaces between two words. The returned string should only have
a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra
spaces.
